# Automatic-text-summarizer

Automatic text summarization is a powerful AI technique that can quickly extract the key points from lengthy documents, articles, or reports into concise, readable summaries. This process leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to rapidly analyse large volumes of text and produce insightful, human-friendly overviews. 
Identify Key Information to extract the most salient facts, concepts, and ideas from a given text.
Generate Coherent Summaries that are fluent, well-structured, and easy to understand. Reduce Information Overload
Text Pre-processing Clean and prepare the input text for more effective summarization. Evaluation and Refinement Assess the quality of the summaries and iteratively improve the models.
